# **SEARCH ENGINE BASICS**

According to definition “A search engine is a software system that is designed to carry out web searches”. Search engines search the web in a systematic way  for particular information specified in a textual web search query.

In this project we are going to build a search engine which can show us the search results it fetched from a few selected web sites.

# **APPROACH FOR BUILDING THE SEARCH ENGINE:** 

A search engine performs four basic processes:
- Crawling
- Indexing 
- Searching
- Ranking

### CRAWLING:
Web search engines get their information by crawling from site to site. The crawler is provided with an entrypoint from which it starts collecting the links and text data and storing them in the database.

### INDEXING:
Indexing means associating the data found on the web pages with the domain it was found on and HTML fields.
The way data is stored in the database is a major contributor to the efficiency of the search engine.

### SEARCHING:
As the name implies searching means to search the database for relevant results to the search query.

### RANKING:
Ranking means to rank the search results found from the above operation in order of their relevance to the user. The better ranking system results in a better search experience.


# **TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THE PROJECT**
- PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
- MONGODB (Text based searching is very easy in mongodb)
- FLASK FRAMEWORK

##### You are welcome to use any other alternatives to the technologies mentioned above.
